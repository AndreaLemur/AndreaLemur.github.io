      institution: Past Global Changes (PAGES), CoralHydro2k Seawater δ<sup>18</sup>O Database Team
      year: 2021-present
      description:
        - Data steward role funded by <a href="https://pastglobalchanges.org/science/wg/data-stewardship-scholarship">PAGES Data Stewardship Scholarship</a> under supervision of Dr. Alyssa Atwood.
        - Collaborating with a team of 26 international early-career and senior scientists on a funded project to preserve seawater oxygen isotopic data long-term for scientific use.
        - Successfully mentored two undergraduates in data curation best practices, including literature reviews, database searching, and data preservation techniques. Developed their skills in survey creation and instructional video production, resulting in improved data collection and dissemination.
        - Co-organizing and facilitating weekly and monthly meetings with an international team using Slack, Google Workspace, and Zoom.
        - Discovered and curated global datasets through extensive literature and database searches.
        - Encouraged the sharing of unpublished data through targeted crowdsourcing campaigns within the oceanographic and paleoclimate communities, resulting in the submission of 5 new datasets totaling over 7,000 observations.
        - Developed and implemented metadata standards to meet FAIR principles, ensuring data discoverability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability.
        - Managing data quality assurance and control on over 19,000 entries, ensuring data accuracy and consistency.
        - Designed and implemented a data submission template and survey to facilitate evaluating dataset quality during ingestion, providing clear example entries and well-defined metadata standards.
        - Led virtual help desk hours during AGU and OSM meetings, improving user engagement with the database and providing guidance on data management best practices, essential metadata, data access workflows, data archiving, and data citation.
        - Contributed to the co-authorship of an article in AGU's Eos magazine and collaborated on oral presentations.
    - title: Graduate Research Assistant
      institution: Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL
      year: 2020-present
      description:
        - Research assistant under the supervision of Dr. Alyssa Atwood. 
        - Developed a new, comprehensive compilation of 76 proxy datasets relating to the 8.2ka Event by conducting extensive literature and database searches, digitizing data, and standardizing data for analysis using open source libraries in R (self-taught).
        - Employed open source libraries in R to identify statistically significant change points in each dataset within age and measurement uncertainties (geoChronR and actR), and assisted actR team in beta testing and troubleshooting with real-world use case via GitHub.
        - Project lead on NCAR/CISL isotope-enabled Community Earth System Model 1.2 (iCESM1.2) experiment (NCAR Small Allocation “North Atlantic Hosing and ITCZ Simulations with iCESM 1.2”).
        - Analyzed data in XLS and netCDF formats using Python packages numpy, xarray, netCD4, matplotlib, cartopy, and pandas.
        - Currently writing thesis and first-author paper for submission to an open access publication.

      year: 2017-2019
      description: 
        - Research assistant under the supervision of Dr. Pamela Grothe.
        - Conducted analyses of Porites spp. fossil coral for mid-Holocene paleo-ENSO reconstruction as part of a long-term project with collaborators from Georgia Institute of Technology and Florida State University.
        - Participated in field work in Kiritimati, Republic of Kiribati in March 2018. Collected Hydnophora spp. fossil corals to establish a novel paleoclimate archive, retrieved Porites spp. core to extend existing geochemical record, and sampled seawater to calibrate δ18Osw signal for the region.
        - Evaluated the diagenetic condition of fossil corals using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to assess the fidelity of isotopic data used in paleo-ENSO reconstructions.
        - Performed stable isotopic analyses (δ18O and δ13C) of fossil coral using ThermoFisher Delta V Plus with Kiel IV Carbonate Device at Georgia Institute of Technology as a visiting member of the Cobb Lab in Summer 2018.
        - Developed instructional manual and Excel workbook for future members of the lab group detailing the preparation of multi-element master stock solutions and dilutions for trace metal analyses of marine carbonates.
        - Trained 5 fellow students on the use of the Hitachi SU3500 variable pressure scanning electron microscope (SEM).
        - Successfully applied for funding for field work and lab supplies, with grant awards totaling over $10,000.
        - Presented research in poster and oral presentations at AGU's Virtual Fall Meeting 2017, UMW's Summer Science Institute 2018, and AGU's Fall Meeting 2018.
        - Co-authored publication in Geophysical Research Letters ("Enhanced El Niño-Southern Oscillation Variability in Recent Decades", Grothe et al., 2019).
