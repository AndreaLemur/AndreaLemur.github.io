I recently graduated with my MSc in Oceanography after working in the <a href="https://alyssaatwood.weebly.com/">Tropical Paleoclimate Dynamics Group</a> at Florida State University.

My research interests are centered around <b>combining high-resolution paleoclimate proxy data with isotope-enabled simulations of global climate</b> to better understand the response of <b>tropical hydroclimate</b> to <b>abrupt climate change</b>.

I have also volunteered as a member of the <b>PAGES CoralHydro2k Seawater δ<sup>18</sup>O Database</b> team, where I act as a <b>data steward</b> and try to make both published and ‘hidden’ seawater oxygen isotopic data <b>FAIR-compliant</b> for broader scientific use.

<b>This page is a work in progress.</b> Feel free to check out any of my work or contact me via the social links below.
