I am a Oceanography MSc student in the <a href="https://alyssaatwood.weebly.com/">Tropical Paleoclimate Dynamics Group</a> at Florida State University.

My current work is centered around <b>combining paleoclimate proxy data with isotope-enabled global climate models</b> to better understand the response of <b>tropical hydroclimate</b> to <b>abrupt climate change</b>.

I am also a member of the <b>PAGES CoralHydro2k Seawater δ<sup>18</sup>O Database</b> team, where I act as a <b>data steward</b> and try to make both published and ‘hidden’ seawater oxygen isotopic data <b>FAIR-compliant</b> for broader scientific use.
