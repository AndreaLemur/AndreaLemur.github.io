I am a Oceanography MSc student in the <a href="https://alyssaatwood.weebly.com/">Tropical Paleoclimate Dynamics Group</a> at Florida State University.

My current work is centered around combining paleoclimate proxy data with isotope-enabled global climate models to better understand the response of tropical hydroclimate to abrupt climate change.

I am also a member of the PAGES CoralHydro2k Seawater δ18O Database team, where I act as a data wrangler and try to make both published and ‘hidden’ seawater oxygen isotopic data FAIR-compliant for broader scientific use.

I am a native of upstate New York who has inadvertently moved further and further south over the last decade. Before landing on science as a career choice, I worked as a professional chef for five years. When I'm not busy doing grad student things, you can find me cooking, gardening, or writing music with my partner, Aedan.
